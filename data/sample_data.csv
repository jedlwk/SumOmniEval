One eyewitness said he saw people blinking lights within the building At least six people have died after a huge fire raged through the night at a west London 24-storey tower block, and police expect that number to rise. Eyewitnesses described people trapped in the burning Grenfell Tower, in north Kensington, screaming for help and yelling for their children to be saved. Firefighters, who rescued many people, were called at 00:54 BST and are still trying to put out the fire. Police say there may still be people in the building who are unaccounted for. The ambulance service said 68 patients had been taken to six hospitals across London, with 18 in critical care. A further 10 patients made their own way to hospital. During the night, eyewitnesses said they saw lights - thought to be mobile phones or torches - flashing at the top of the block of flats, and trapped residents coming to their windows - some holding children. It is understood that ""several hundred"" people would have been in the block when the fire broke out shortly after midnight, most of them sleeping.

Mickey, a resident of Grenfell Tower: 'It was like a horror movie' Commander Stuart Cundy, of the Metropolitan Police, said the recovery operation would be ""complex and lengthy"", and the number of fatalities was expected to rise. He declined to give any details of the number of people who may be missing. He said it was likely to be some time before police could identify the victims, adding that it was too early to speculate on the cause of the fire. An emergency number - 0800 0961 233 - has been set up for anyone concerned about friends or family. At 13:00 BST, Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton said firefighters expected to be on the scene for at least another 24 hours. She said there were concerns that people were still inside the tower and she urged all residents to make sure they had reported themselves to police so that the authorities know they are safe. Prime Minister Theresa May is ""deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life"", said Downing Street. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt praised the ""heroic"" response from the emergency services and the NHS hospital staff ""working tirelessly to help"". Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to demand a government statement in Parliament on Thursday on the tragedy, the BBC understands. There must be a ""full inquiry"" into the fire, newly-elected Kensington MP Emma Dent Coad told the BBC. Speaking outside the Rugby Portobello Trust emergency centre, the Labour MP said the fire was ""absolutely appalling"". ""The ferocity of that fire was extraordinary and terrifying,"" she said. ""This must never happen again."" Police and fire minister Nick Hurd was due to chair a cross-party meeting to look at how the government can assist the emergency services and local authorities.

David Benjamin says he was woken by a neighbour banging on the door Paul Munakr, who lives on the seventh floor, managed to escape. ""As I was going down the stairs, there were firefighters, truly amazing firefighters that were actually going upstairs, to the fire, trying to get as many people out the building as possible,"" he told the BBC. He said he was alerted to the fire not by fire alarms but by people on the street below, shouting ""don't jump, don't jump"". Eyewitness Jody Martin said: ""I watched one person falling out, I watched another woman holding her baby out the window... hearing screams. ""I was yelling at everyone to get down and they were saying 'We can't leave our apartments, the smoke is too bad on the corridors.'"" Michael Paramasivan, who lives on the seventh floor with his girlfriend and young daughter, said he ignored official advice to stay in your home. ""If we had stayed in that flat, we would've perished. My gut instinct told me just to get the girls out. I wrapped the little one up because of the smoke and I just got them out."" Another resident, Zoe, who lives on the fourth floor, said she was woken by a neighbour banging on her door. ""The whole landing was thick with smoke. The smoke alarms weren't going off but the way it spread so quickly from the fourth floor, all the way up to the 23rd floor was scary."" Mirna, Fatima and Zainnb are among those missing They have lost their homes and for some, tragically their relatives. At times there is the sound of sobbing as the word goes round that someone is missing, someone is feared dead. I've spent the day inside the community centre where survivors have gathered. Downstairs in the hall families sit at tables and wait for news. One family told me they hadn't heard from their brother, sister and three children - Mirna, Fatima and Zainnb. Other relatives were out searching hospitals. There was still no news. Outside the centre, Sawsan was with a group of women. For one it was too much, she was on the floor crying. Sawsan hasn't heard from her mum, sister, brother-in-law and nieces. She spoke to them when the fire started but nothing since. Inside the centre, families are being helped with food, housing and medical treatment. It's busy and everyone is helping. Just not with the one thing they need - information about whether their relatives are safe. Christabel told me how lucky her father had been. He tried to fight the fire but made it out alive. Ed was saved when a friend called him to tell him to get out the building. ""I'm lucky"" he says. But they have lost everything. Grenfell Tower, built in 1974, is part of the Lancaster West Estate, a sprawling inner-city social housing complex of almost 1,000 homes. Robert Black, chief executive of the tower's management company, the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, said: ""The fire at Grenfell Tower is devastating and the reports of injury and losses of life absolutely heartbreaking. ""Along with my colleagues, I have been supporting residents since the early hours, working with the emergency services and the community."" The BBC's Andy Moore, who was at the scene through the night, described watching debris falling from the building, and hearing explosions and breaking glass. London fire crews said it was a ""large and very serious incident"" There are 120 flats in the residential block The London Fire Brigade said a structural engineer had checked the building and determined it was not in danger of collapse and that rescue teams were safe to be inside. Initially, it was feared that the building, which appears to be gutted, could collapse. Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was devastated by the horrific scenes, attended by more than 250 firefighters and 100 ambulance medics. Questions will need to be answered over the safety of tower blocks, he told BBC Radio. ""We can't have a situation where people's safety is put at risk because of bad advice being given or if it is the case, as has been alleged, of tower blocks not being properly serviced or maintained,"" he said. Matt Wrack, of the Fire Brigades Union said something had clearly gone badly wrong with fire prevention procedures at the building. Firefighters would normally fight a fire in a tower block from the inside, going up the fire escape, and fighting using the internal dry-rising mains, he said, but that's not been possible in this case. Construction firm Rydon said recent building work which it carried out on the block ""met all required building control, fire regulation and health and safety standards"". Refurbishment work completed in 2016 included more residential areas in the four lower 'podium' levels Appeals are being made on social media for news of missing friends and relatives, who might have been caught in the blaze. Emergency rest centres have opened for those now homeless at Latymer Community Centre, St Clement's Church, Harrow Club and Rugby Portobello Trust. There are also local collections under way for spare clothes, toys, blankets and toiletries. People are being advised by police to stay away from the area, where roads remain closed and nearby residents have been evacuated as a precaution. The London Fire Brigade said a structural engineer had checked the building More than 70 people have received treatment in hospital Smoke could be seen from miles away Grenfell Tower underwent a two-year £10m refurbishment as part of a wider transformation of the estate, that was completed last year. The 24-storey tower, containing about 120 flats, is managed by the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO) on behalf of the council. Before and during the refurbishment, the local Grenfell Action Group claimed that the block constituted a fire risk and residents warned that site access for emergency vehicles was ""severely restricted"". Construction firm Rydon, which carried out the refurbishment, said it was ""shocked to hear of the devastating fire"" and added that the work ""met all required building control, fire regulation and health and safety standards"". Council leader Nick Paget-Brown said the buildings were regularly inspected, but a ""thorough investigation"" was needed.

* Grenfell Tower, a 24-storey residential building in north Kensington containing approximately 120 flats, caught fire shortly after midnight on Wednesday, with firefighters arriving at 00:54 BST. The blaze raged through the night, with eyewitnesses reporting residents trapped at upper floors, some holding children and signaling with mobile phone lights from windows as smoke spread rapidly from the fourth floor upward.

* At least six people have died with police expecting the death toll to rise significantly, and 68 patients were transported to six London hospitals, including 18 in critical care, with a further 10 self-presenting. Metropolitan Police Commander Stuart Cundy stated the recovery operation would be ""complex and lengthy,"" declining to specify missing person estimates but confirming authorities expect fatalities to increase. Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton reported firefighters expected to remain on scene for at least 24 additional hours, expressing concern that people remained trapped inside. Approximately 250 firefighters and 100 ambulance medics responded to the incident. The tower, built in 1974 and managed by the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, underwent a £10 million refurbishment completed in 2016, though the Grenfell Action Group had previously raised fire safety concerns about the building and restricted emergency vehicle access.

**In essence, a catastrophic tower block fire killed at least six residents with dozens hospitalized and many unaccounted for, prompting urgent investigation into building safety protocols.**"
"Kim Edwards murdered her mother and sister with the help of boyfriend Lucas Markham A judge has ruled that teenager Kim Edwards can be identified as having killed her mother and sister. But how did their relationship turn from love to loathing? As the details of the cold and brutal killings of Elizabeth Edwards and her daughter Katie were read out in court, the facts seemed at odds with the slight and seemingly timid teenager sitting in the dock. Nottingham Crown Court heard how she and her boyfriend Lucas Markham, both aged 14 at the time, had plotted for days to cut their victims' throats as they slept at the family home in Spalding, Lincolnshire. A grudge Kim held against her mother - and her bitter resentment of her mother's close relationship with her sister - was the motivation for the murders, prosecutor Peter Joyce QC said. But it was not until jurors heard the details of a series of interviews Kim gave to police and psychiatrists that the depth of her hatred was revealed. Elizabeth Edwards, 49, and her daughter Katie, 13, were found dead at their home in Spalding ""I wanted to get revenge for the way she treated me,"" Kim told one psychiatrist. ""I did it because I did not like Mum at all and I did not want her to ruin or corrupt anyone else. ""I did not feel anything for my mother, she deserved it and I'm glad she's dead."" She also told detectives: ""Ever since I was young I never got on with my mum, she always favoured my sister."" In the three-person household of 5 Dawson Avenue she felt unwanted, unloved and cut adrift. Mrs Edwards and her daughter Katie were murdered in their beds Prosecutors said Kim showed ""utter contempt"" for her mother and her sister (pictured) The court heard the difficulties between Kim and her mother could be traced back to January 2008 when Mrs Edwards had struck Kim, aged six at the time, in a row over the television. Mrs Edwards referred herself to social services and Kim and Katie were placed in care for several months. Social services closed the file on the Edwards family later that same year but Mrs Edwards would later say she believed Kim never truly forgave her. The issues between Mrs Edwards and her eldest daughter resurfaced in 2013 and lurched from one problem to another over the next three years. In September 2013, Mrs Edwards told Kim's teachers her daughter was planning to run away, although by March 2014 she told them their relationship had improved. Eight months later Kim told support workers her mother had tried to strangle her, but this was denied by both Mrs Edwards and her sister. In January 2015 Mrs Edwards asked her GP for family therapy. Kim Edwards and her mother shared a Facebook conversation just 10 days before the killings At the start of 2015 Mrs Edwards arranged an emergency psychiatric appointment after discovering a suicide note left by Kim. Following an assessment, no evidence of mental illness was found, however. In August of the same year the child and adolescent mental health services in Lincolnshire reported Kim's relationship with her mother was much better but Kim was feeling left out of the family triangle. In May of that year, Kim had begun her relationship with Lucas. The pair ran away from home in October, before being discovered six days later sleeping rough in woods north of Spalding. Mrs Edwards disapproved of her daughter's relationship with Lucas, the court heard. In the weeks before her death, the churchgoing dinner lady had barred Lucas from her home, forcing the couple to meet in the garden, and had described the couple as ""a time-bomb waiting to go off"". Kim told psychiatrists that by this stage her life had become a ""like a living, walking hell"", and in March she tried to kill herself by taking an overdose of painkillers. The following month the fast deteriorating mother-daughter relationship blew up with murderous consequences. A psychiatrist described the teenagers' relationship as ""toxic"" In court, psychiatrists Dr Philip Joseph and Dr Indranil Chakrabarti attempted to explain what led to the killings. Dr Joseph, for the prosecution, blamed the toxic ""Bonnie and Clyde"" relationship between Kim and Lucas. He said Kim had not been suffering from a recognised mental disorder but had been struggling to feel part of the family unit. ""In that triangle she felt very much left out,"" he said. ""She felt that her mother was very much more attached to her younger sister."" He said she had told him the family dynamic made her feel unhappy and she was ""jealous"" of her sister. She felt the only solution was to kill her mother. ""I was getting rid of the only problem I could see,"" Kim had told him. ""I thought it would have been better for my sister to die too. ""I was not killing my sister out of anger, and I miss her, but I was excited about killing my mother and I was looking forward to it."" Kim and Lucas had been in a relationship since May 2015 Dr Chakrabarti, for the defence, contended Kim had an adjustment disorder and longstanding attachment issues as a result of her strained relationship with her mother. He said the disorder had been brought on by a series of stressful events, including Lucas being expelled from school and her attempt to kill herself. He also pointed to a row between Kim and her mother on 9 April in which Mrs Edwards told Kim she would turn out like her father, who had left the family home when she was two years old. Following the argument, Kim had gone to Lucas's home and the couple barricaded themselves in his room overnight. When Kim returned home she found her mother had bagged up some of her possessions and given others to her sister. Kim had told Dr Chakrabarti her mother's actions had left her feeling like she ""did not belong to the family anymore"". The following day, the court was told, she and Lucas began plotting the killings. Kim Edwards said she was ""jealous"" of her sister Katie (left) and her relationship with their mother On the night of the murders, Kim let Lucas into the house through the bathroom window. He had brought a bag of knives with him. Lucas took one of the knives and crept in to Mrs Edwards room where he stabbed her through the throat - he stabbed her eight times while smothering her with a pillow to stop her screaming out. He then went in to Katie's room and stabbed her twice in the neck while she slept. Following the murders, Kim and Lucas had sex on a mattress in the living room, ate ice cream and settled down to watch the vampire-themed Twilight films. Over the next day-and-a-half they stayed at the house. They ignored visits from Lucas's aunt and police officers sent to the property to look for the two teenagers, who by now had been reported missing from school. It was not until police forced their way into the house through a downstairs window that the couple were discovered. PC Alistair Pullen, who was the first officer to enter the house, said that when he asked where Mrs Edwards was Lucas ""looked at me clean in the eye and said 'Why don't you go up and see?'"". Kim would later tell Dr Joseph: ""We felt laid back about what had happened - neither of us felt that bad about it."" Det Ch Insp Martin Holvey, who led the murder investigation, said: ""The actual after-effects are probably the most chilling, the fact of what happened in those 36 hours after and how they carried on as normal, watching TV, watching a film, going upstairs to use the toilet while people are lying upstairs dead; it beggars belief."" He said he believed the ""tragic and unprecedented"" killings had been a result of a combination of issues. ""I guess many people through life will say things, especially juveniles, that they don't mean - 'I hate you' or 'I'm going to kill you'. ""It's a throwaway comment for many, many people, but this wasn't, this carried on, and they carried on talking about it over the next few days."" The whole truth of what happened in the Edwards' family home will probably never be known. The jury rejected Kim's version of events and decided she did not have a psychological condition which would diminish her responsibility. It leaves only an inescapable, if unpalatable, conclusion - that this 14-year-old girl was so consumed by hatred for her mother, she decided to kill her and her sister as well.","### Teenager Convicted in Throat-Slashing Double Murder

* Kim Edwards, aged 14 at the time of the crimes, plotted with boyfriend Lucas Markham, also 14, to murder her mother Elizabeth Edwards, 49, and sister Katie Edwards, 13, at their home at 5 Dawson Avenue in Spalding, Lincolnshire. Nottingham Crown Court heard that the pair carried out the killings in April 2015, with Markham entering through a bathroom window carrying knives and fatally stabbing both victims in their beds while they slept.

* The court established that Kim harbored deep resentment toward her mother stemming from a 2008 incident when Mrs. Edwards struck her over a television dispute, and intensifying jealousy over her mother's closer relationship with her younger sister. Prosecutor Peter Joyce QC presented evidence that Kim told psychiatrists: ""I wanted to get revenge for the way she treated me"" and ""I was excited about killing my mother and I was looking forward to it."" Following the murders, the teenagers remained in the house for 36 hours, watching films, eating ice cream, and ignoring police visits before officers discovered the bodies. Detective Chief Inspector Martin Holvey stated the killings were ""tragic and unprecedented,"" noting the couple's callous behavior afterward ""beggars belief."" The jury rejected Kim's psychological defense claims, finding her fully culpable for the murders.

**In essence, a 14-year-old girl orchestrated her mother and sister's murder driven by familial resentment and toxic relationship dynamics with her boyfriend.**"
"Flames are still visible on the lower floors of the building At least 17 people died in a massive fire that engulfed a west London block of flats, police said, as they warned that figure could rise further. Earlier, the fire service said rescuers did not expect to find any more survivors in the smouldering ruins of Grenfell Tower, in north Kensington. Sniffer dogs are to be sent in to search for evidence and identification of people still inside. The Queen has said her ""thoughts and prayers"" are with families. People have been desperately seeking news of missing family and friends. More than 30 people remain in hospital - 17 of whom are in a critical condition. The prime minister spoke to fire commissioner Dany Cotton as she surveyed the damage Labour's Jeremy Corbyn spoke to firefighters and community leaders on a visit Prime Minister Theresa May, who made a brief private visit to the scene, has promised a full investigation, as questions are asked about the speed at which the fire spread. Later, Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn told community leaders ""the truth has to come out"" on a separate visit to the site. Firefighters were called to the 24-storey residential tower in the early hours of Wednesday, at a time when hundreds of people were inside, most of them sleeping. Many were woken by neighbours, or shouts from below, and fled the building. Fire crews rescued 65 adults and children, but some stayed in their homes, trapped by smoke and flames. On Thursday morning, London Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton said her crews had identified a ""number of people, but we know there will be more"". The size of the building means it could take weeks, she added. Asked how many were still missing, Met Police Commander Stuart Cundy said it would be ""wrong and incredibly distressing"" to give a number. ""I know one person was reported 46 times to the casualty bureau,"" he said. A brief search of all floors in the tower had been carried out, but the severity of the fire and amount of debris meant a thorough search would be ""difficult and painstaking"", Commander Cotton said. Fire seemed to spread quickly across the tower block's cladding Community centres were inundated with donations from across London and the UK Temporary structures will be built inside the block in order to shore it up before more thorough work can begin. The cause of the fire, which took more than 24 hours to bring under control, remains unknown. Throughout the morning, only smoke was seen coming from the charred building, but by Thursday lunchtime flames flared up again on one of the lower floors. Dozens of people left homeless spent the night in makeshift rescue centres, as well-wishers signed a wall of condolence near the site. London-born singer Adele and her husband visited the scene on Wednesday evening, and was seen comforting people. Singer Rita Ora also pitched in, helping to sort donations outside the tower. Photographs and messages in English and Arabic have been left for loved ones. Alongside them are words of anger and calls for justice, with people saying their safety concerns were not listened to. The local authority - Kensington and Chelsea council - said 44 households had been placed in emergency accommodation so far. Through the night, people donated food, clothes and blankets for those left without homes. By early morning some volunteers said they were overwhelmed with donations and were turning people and vans away. One volunteer, Bhupinder Singh, said: ""It is times like this that the best of our community comes out. This is where you find out how good it is to be a Londoner."" An emotional Adele was seen hugging some of those caught up in the fire This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. London Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton said specialist dogs will be used during the investigation Questions have been raised about why the fire appeared to spread so quickly and engulf the entire building. BBC Newsnight's Chris Cook says the type of cladding on the outside of Grenfell Tower, installed in 2015 during a refurbishment, had a polyethylene - or plastic - core, instead of a more fireproof alternative with a mineral core. Similar cladding was used in high-rise buildings hit by fires in France, the UAE and Australia, he said. The government has said checks were now planned on tower blocks that have gone through a similar upgrade. Construction firm Rydon, which carried out the refurbishment, initially said in a statement that the work met ""all fire regulations"" - the wording was omitted in a later statement. Fire risk assessment in tower blocks was ""less rigorous"" since responsibility for it shifted from the fire brigade to the owner, Sian Berry, housing committee chairwoman of the London Assembly, said. Concerns have also been raised about fire alarms not going off and the lack of sprinklers. It is still possible to build tall buildings without sprinklers, said Russ Timpson of the Tall Buildings Fire Safety Network, but he expected regulations might change soon. Overseas colleagues are ""staggered"" when they hear tall buildings are built in the UK with a single staircase, he added. Roy Wilsher, chair of the National Fire Chiefs Council, said that if the fire spread up the outside of the tower, sprinklers might not have made a difference. Design and regulations for such tower blocks mean fire should be contained in a single flat, he said. ""Clearly something's gone wrong in this case."" Jessica Urbano Ramirez, 12, is believed to have become separated from her family This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. A local nurse ran towards the burning building to try to help victims Meanwhile, appeals are being made on social media for news of friends and family who are still unaccounted for. Among them are 12-year-old Jessica Urbano Ramirez and 66-year-old grandfather Tony Disson, from the 22nd floor. Security guard Mo Tuccu, who was visiting friends in the tower to break the Ramadan fast, is also missing. One family from the 17th floor has five people missing. Husna Begum and four other family members were last heard from two hours after the fire started. Labour MP David Lammy is appealing for information about his friend, Khadija Saye, and her mother, Mary Mendy. An emergency number - 0800 0961 233 - has been set up for anyone concerned about friends or family. Read more about the missing here. Stories continue to emerge from survivors and eyewitnesses. One man, who lives in the neighbourhood, said he saw people banging at the window and children screaming. He said he knew one family with five children under the age of 10 who were all missing.

Michael Paramasivan, who lived on the seventh floor with his girlfriend and young daughter, was among many who defied official advice to stay put, and ran with their families down dark, smoke-filled corridors to get out of the building. ""If we had stayed in that flat, we would've perished,"" he said. People in the street below described watching as a baby was thrown from a window, people jumped and climbed down the side of the burning tower using ropes made from bed sheets. Jody Martin said: ""I was yelling at everyone to get down and they were saying 'We can't leave our apartments, the smoke is too bad on the corridors'.""","### West London Tower Fire Kills At Least 17, Search Ongoing

* Firefighters responded to a massive fire at Grenfell Tower, a 24-storey residential block in north Kensington, west London, in the early hours of Wednesday when hundreds of residents were sleeping. The fire spread rapidly across the building's exterior cladding, taking more than 24 hours to bring under control, with flames still visible on lower floors as of Thursday afternoon.

Kyle Crickmore fled the beach with his family after they started feeling unwell About 150 people have been treated in hospital and hundreds more affected by an unknown gas which hit the East Sussex coast. Birling Gap beach was evacuated on Sunday after people reported breathing difficulties, stinging eyes and vomiting when a ""mist"" appeared. Sussex Police said on Monday morning the gas cloud appeared to have cleared. Agencies are investigating the cause and have not ruled out either on-shore or off-shore locations. The advice to keep windows and doors shut in affected areas has now been withdrawn In the past, chemicals have drifted across from European industrial units, but Sussex Police said: ""Weather models suggest that an onshore source in northern France is very unlikely."" The Coastguard said it was working with its French counterparts and looking into vessels that were in the area at the time. East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service said it was ""extremely unlikely"" the substance involved was chlorine. People had been arriving at Birling Gap to enjoy the Bank Holiday weather Beaches in the area were open as normal on Monday and thousands were expected to flock to the coast as temperatures reach up to 25C (75F). Jonathan Hill, 28, who lives close to Birling Gap beach, said people had begun arriving at the beach on Monday although ""it's maybe a bit less busy than usual"". He said he returned from holiday with his girlfriend at about 16:30 BST on Sunday and immediately began to suffer. He said: ""We got home, threw open the windows to air the house and quickly developed stingy eyes. At one point I couldn't see for about five minutes."" Bob Jefferey, of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) Eastbourne Division said: ""Whatever it was, it smelled like burnt plastic. ""It hung about and didn't move yesterday because there was no wind."" The first reports on Sunday came in from Birling Gap, between Eastbourne and Seaford, just before 17:00 BST where people reported having irritated eyes. The plume of gas moved eastwards along the coast as far as Bexhill, police said. Coastguard rescue teams from Birling Gap, Eastbourne, Bexhill and Newhaven raced to help clear the busy beaches as visitors feared they had been struck by a chlorine leak. Police, fire and ambulance services raced to the scene after reports of a ""chemical haze"" Roy Page, from East Peckham, Kent, was on the beach at the time when what appeared to be a sea mist rolled in from the west. He described it as a colourless, odourless, mist that was ""seriously painful on the eyes"". Kyle Crickmore, who was at the Birling Gap beach with his family, said it emptied within 10 minutes after people began to feel unwell. ""It was definitely out of the ordinary considering it was a nice, clear, sunny day 10 minutes beforehand,"" he added. ""It was stupidly busy and it was a boiling hot day. ""It emptied in about 10 minutes, which was quite staggering considering the amount of people who were there."" Beachgoers were checked over at Eastbourne General District Hospital Long queues built up at Eastbourne General District Hospital well into the evening, with approximately 150 people being treated, East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust said. ""Initially, patients were dealt with as a precaution with a full decontamination treatment, but it became clear that this was not necessary, following clinical advice,"" a spokesman said. Members of the public alerted emergency services, which triggered callouts to the UK Coastguard, Sussex Police, South Eastern Ambulance Service and East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service, who said they were treating it as a ""chemical incident"".

* Approximately 150 people were treated at Eastbourne General District Hospital on Sunday after an unidentified gas cloud struck Birling Gap beach near Eastbourne, East Sussex, around 17:00 BST. The plume caused immediate respiratory distress and eye irritation among beachgoers, prompting rapid evacuation of the crowded Bank Holiday beach and triggering multi-agency emergency response including UK Coastguard, Sussex Police, South Eastern Ambulance Service, and East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service.

* The gas cloud dispersed eastward along the coast toward Bexhill by Monday morning, with Sussex Police confirming the incident was ""isolated and not expected to recur."" East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust stated that ""initially, patients were dealt with as a precaution with a full decontamination treatment, but it became clear that this was not necessary, following clinical advice."" Investigators have not ruled out on-shore or off-shore sources, though East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service deemed chlorine ""extremely unlikely"" as the causative agent. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution's Bob Jefferey noted the substance ""smelled like burnt plastic"" and remained stationary due to lack of wind. Sussex Police indicated weather models suggest ""an onshore source in northern France is very unlikely,"" while the Coastguard is coordinating with French authorities and examining vessels in the area. Hundreds of additional people experienced symptoms, and affected residents were advised to keep windows and doors shut until the cloud cleared.

**In essence, an unidentified airborne chemical caused mass beach evacuation and hospitalization, with origin and composition remaining under active investigation.**"

* A six-car pile-up occurred on Belgrave Middleway in Birmingham's Edgbaston district in the early hours of Sunday, killing six people and injuring at least 13 others. The crash involved three vehicles directly, with three additional cars sustaining minor damage while attempting to avoid the collision on the underpass where Belgrave and Lee Bank Middleway meet.

* Fatalities include taxi driver Imtiaz Mohammed, 33, a father of six children under age 15, whose two passengers (a 43-year-old woman and 42-year-old man) also died; Mohammed Fahsha, 30; Tauqeer Hussain, 26; and a 25-year-old man—all from Birmingham's Small Heath area. A 22-year-old remains in serious condition at Queen Elizabeth Hospital; four others were treated at Heartlands Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries; two were discharged at scene. West Midlands Police Superintendent Sean Phillips stated it was ""too early to speculate on the cause,"" noting that ""it will take some time to unpick and understand exactly what's happened."" The road had been gritted at 17:00 GMT Saturday. Police are investigating multiple factors including road conditions and potential speed-related causes, with the 40mph speed limit stretch closed during investigation. Sergeant Alan Hands confirmed officers are ""still trying to establish exactly what happened"" and requested public assistance with footage.

**In essence, a six-fatality crash on a Birmingham underpass remains under active investigation with cause undetermined pending collision analysis.**"
"Seven people were killed when a tram derailed near to Sandilands in November 2016 The driver of a tram which derailed in Croydon had probably dozed off moments before the fatal crash, an official report has found. Seven people died and more than 50 were injured in the derailment in south London in November last year. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch also found action was not taken following a similar speeding incident just days before the tragedy. The 174-page report has made 15 recommendations to improve tram safety. These include the creation of a dedicated safety body for UK tramways, a better understanding of risk of trams and the introduction of stronger windows and doors on trams. Investigators say all the fatalities and many of the serious injuries were caused by passengers being thrown out of carriage windows. The tram was running from New Addington to Wimbledon via Croydon, and was on the approach to Sandilands tram stop soon after 06:00 on 9 November 2016. A previous report said although the speed limit approaching the junction was 12mph, the tram had been travelling at an estimated speed of 45mph. Investigators found the tram derailed while travelling at three-and-a-half times the speed limit The report said the most likely cause for the driver not applying the brakes was ""a temporary loss of awareness of the driving task during a period of low workload, which possibly caused him to micro-sleep"". It adds: ""It is also possible that when regaining awareness, the driver became confused about his location and direction of travel."" Tests found no drugs or alcohol in the driver's system and no medical abnormalities were identified in him. Simon French, RAIB's chief inspector of rail accidents, added: ""There is no direct evidence of the driver closing his eyes or being asleep."" When interviewed as part of the investigation, the driver said he had ""no recollection"" and ""couldn't explain what happened"", according to Mr French. A criminal investigation is being led by the British Transport Police (BTP) who arrested the driver on suspicion of manslaughter. The 43-year-old man, from Beckenham, remains on bail, a BTP spokesman said. The RAIB report also found management were not aware of previous incidents involving late braking on the approach to Sandilands. Some of this was down to a ""reluctance of some drivers to report their own mistakes"", the report said. On 31 October a passenger raised concerns about a tram which went ""too fast"" round a bend near Sandilands. The driver of that tram applied the hazard brake, but the driver did not report the incident. The RAIB said on Thursday, that tram ""came close to coming off the tracks."" People were ""ejected"" from the carriage and some became trapped and crushed as the speeding tram ground to a halt, the report found. The RAIB is advising tram operators throughout the UK to make sure windows are fitted with stronger glass. London's Transport Commissioner Mike Brown said: ""Since the incident we have introduced a wide range of additional safety measures to make sure such a tragedy can never happen again. A stone plinth has been built as a memorial to the victims ""These include new signage and warning systems for drivers, additional speed restrictions, enhanced speed monitoring and an upgrade of the CCTV recording system. ""An in-cab driver protection device has been trialled and is now fitted to every tram, meaning that any sign of driver distraction or fatigue results in the driver being alerted immediately. Work to install a system to automatically reduce tram speeds if required is also underway."" The Croydon tram service is run on behalf of TfL by Tram Operations Limited, a subsidiary of FirstGroup. Tim O'Toole, FirstGroup's chief executive officer, extended his condolences to the victims and added: ""The RAIB concluded that management of fatigue was not a factor in the incident, nor did a speeding culture contribute to it. ""Nevertheless, over the past year we have taken a series of actions, working closely with TfL on whose behalf we operate the system, to implement additional measures including enhanced speed monitoring and restrictions, improved signage and renewed guidance on fatigue management."" What is totally damning is how fundamentally broken the reporting and complaints process was at the tram operator run by First Group. Drivers were afraid to report for fear of recriminations and when passengers complained - such as after a speeding incident on 31 October just 10 days before the crash - the investigation was glacial. The families of those who died are heartbroken and outraged that opportunities to stop speeding incidents were missed. In fact, the complaints procedure has been deemed so broken, TfL has taken it away from FirstGroup and brought it back in house. Again this will raise huge questions about the fragmentation of the transport industry and I'm sure questions about the role of privatisation and companies operating concessions on behalf of public bodies. Despite the RAIB publishing its findings, there are still other separate investigations being carried out in parallel with each other. TfL has commissioned its own probe into the disaster, while the Office for Road and Rail (ORR) is looking at whether there were any health and safety breaches which contributed to the crash. In response to the report, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: ""This was a preventable accident, seven people lost their lives and they shouldn't have done so. It's really important we learn lessons."" The driver's union ASLEF's Finn Brennan said tram drivers still have a ""fear"" of being sacked if they ""report being tired or sick"". He added ""management culture"" at Tram Operations Ltd meant mistakes were not listened to and acted on properly. Sarah Jones, MP for Croydon Central, said: ""Our first thoughts will always be for the victims' families. ""They will be reliving this tragedy yet again, and it will be another difficult day for them. The most important thing we can do for them is show that lessons have been learned and make sure this never happens again.""

* A tram operating the New Addington-to-Wimbledon route derailed near Sandilands in south London on November 9, 2016, at approximately 06:00, killing seven passengers and injuring more than 50 others. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) completed its 174-page investigation, determining the tram was traveling at 45 mph—three-and-a-half times the 12 mph speed limit—when it left the tracks, causing passengers to be ejected through carriage windows.

* RAIB Chief Inspector Simon French concluded the most probable cause was ""a temporary loss of awareness of the driving task during a period of low workload, which possibly caused him to micro-sleep,"" though he noted ""there is no direct evidence of the driver closing his eyes or being asleep."" The 43-year-old driver from Beckenham, arrested on suspicion of manslaughter by British Transport Police, remains on bail with no recollection of the incident. The investigation revealed a critical safety gap: a similar speeding incident occurred on October 31, nine days prior, when a passenger reported excessive speed near Sandilands, but management was not informed due to driver reluctance to self-report and inadequate complaint procedures. The RAIB issued 15 safety recommendations, including creation of a dedicated UK tramway safety body, stronger windows and doors, and enhanced fatigue-monitoring systems. TfL has since implemented in-cab driver protection devices and automatic speed-reduction systems, while transferring complaint procedures from operator FirstGroup to in-house management.

**In essence, driver fatigue combined with systemic reporting failures and missed warning signs enabled a preventable tragedy that killed seven passengers.**"

CCTV showed Darren Osborne's movements before and during the attack A man who drove a van into a crowd of Muslims near a London mosque has been found guilty of murder. Darren Osborne, 48, ploughed into people in Finsbury Park in June last year, killing Makram Ali, 51, and injuring nine others. Osborne, from Cardiff, was also found guilty of attempted murder and is due to be sentenced on Friday. Prosecutors said they were ""clear throughout that this was a terrorist attack"". The jury took an hour to return the verdict at Woolwich Crown Court after a nine day trial. Sue Hemming, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""Darren Osborne planned and carried out this attack because of his hatred of Muslims. He must now face the consequences of his actions."" Darren Osborne was found guilty of murder and attempted murder, at Woolwich Crown Court Cdr Dean Haydon from the Metropolitan Police said: ""Osborne's evil and cowardly actions meant a family has tragically lost a husband, father and grandfather."" Some of those injured ""could suffer from health issues for the rest of their lives"", he added. Jurors heard the area outside the Muslim Welfare House had been busy with worshippers attending Ramadan prayers on 19 June. Mr Ali had collapsed at the roadside in the minutes before the attack. Several of those who went to help him said he was alive and conscious in the moments before being struck by the van. Makram Ali, 51, was killed in the attack Osborne drove the van into the crowd at about 00:15. Jurors were told the van only stopped when it hit some bollards. He then got out of the van and ran towards the crowd. This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. CCTV shows the moments before a van hit a crowd near Finsbury Park mosque Police later found a letter in the van written by Osborne, referring to Muslim people as ""rapists"" and ""feral"". He also wrote that Muslim men were ""preying on our children"". The trial heard Osborne became ""obsessed"" with Muslims in the weeks leading up to the attack, having watched the BBC drama Three Girls, about the Rochdale grooming scandal. In just a few weeks, Darren Osborne went from a troubled, angry and unpredictably violent alcoholic to a killer driven by ideology. The rapid radicalisation - the way he became fixated on the idea that Muslims in Britain were some kind of nation within a nation, is one of the most shocking parts of this awful crime. The sources of that radicalisation, including his obsession with a television programme about the Rochdale abuse scandal, show how difficult it is to predict who will become a danger to society. But the fact that he smiled contentedly after he had run over and killed Makram Ali proved to the jury that his motive was ideological. Osborne is not the first terrorist to have radicalised so quickly. In 2014, a young man who was groomed by Islamists went through a similarly rapid change. The speed at which these men and others went from a change of mindset to planning an attack is one of the issues that most concerns the security services. Osborne told the court he had originally hired the van to kill Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn at a march he was due to attend. He said it ""would have been even better"" if London Mayor Sadiq Khan had been present, adding: ""It would have been like winning the lottery."" Responding to the verdict, Mr Corbyn - who is MP for the area where the attack took place - said it was ""a hate-filled attack that... shocked us all"". ""I was proud of how, in the wake of this terrible event, we all came together to reject hate and embrace hope, and that is the kind of country we live in,"" he added. A statement from his partner Sarah Andrews, read out in court, said he seemed ""brainwashed"" and ""totally obsessed"". Ms Andrews - who had been in a relationship with Mr Osborne for about 20 years and with whom she had four children - described him as a ""loner and a functioning alcoholic"" with an ""unpredictable temperament"". Osborne started following Tommy Robinson, one of the founders of the English Defence League (EDL), and other far-right leaders on social media, in the fortnight before the attack. Mr Robinson sent him a group email saying: ""There is a nation within a nation forming beneath the surface of the UK. It is a nation built on hatred, on violence and on Islam."" This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Jurors were shown footage which allegedly shows Darren Osborne writing at a pub table two days before the attack Cdr Haydon said the investigation had the ""full weight"" of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command behind it. He warned that online material had played a ""significant role"" in how Osborne was radicalised and ""brainwashed"". If Osborne's aim had been to ""create divisions and hate between communities"", then he had ""failed"", he said. ""The response [of those involved], and the overwhelmingly positive reaction my officers and teams have witnessed since, highlights how far from reality Osborne's sick and twisted views really are,"" he added. The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) welcomed the verdict, but added: ""We cannot be complacent and regard this as a one-off terrorist incident."" Harun Khan, secretary general of the MCB, said: ""The scenes we witnessed last summer were the most violent manifestation of Islamophobia yet in our country. ""The case tells us that we must all exercise caution when tempted to stigmatise any group of people, regardless of colour, creed or community."" Khalid Oumar, a trustee of the mosque and founder of the Finsbury Park Attack victims' voice forum, praised the strength of the community, adding: ""The scars will stay with them forever, but the community is determined to go about daily life without fear and to stand together against victimisation and violence.""","### Finsbury Park Van Attack: Guilty Verdict on Murder Charges

* Darren Osborne, 48, from Cardiff, drove a van into a crowd of Muslim worshippers outside the Muslim Welfare House near Finsbury Park mosque in London on June 19 at approximately 00:15, killing one person and injuring nine others. The attack occurred during Ramadan prayers when the area was busy with congregants; the van only stopped after striking bollards, and Osborne then exited and ran toward the crowd.

"Yulia Skripal and her father Sergei are critically ill in hospital The UK would respond ""robustly"" to any evidence of Russian involvement in the collapse of former spy Sergei Skripal, Boris Johnson has said. Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are critically ill in hospital after being found unconscious in Salisbury, Wiltshire. The foreign secretary said he was not pointing fingers at this stage, but described Russia as ""a malign and disruptive force"". Downing Street said Home Secretary Amber Rudd will chair a meeting of Cobra, the government's emergency committee, on Wednesday to discuss the Salisbury investigation. Counter Terrorism Police have taken over the investigation from Wiltshire Police. But in a statement, the unit said the inquiry had not been declared a terrorist incident and there was no risk to the wider public. Relatives of Mr Skripal - a former Russian colonel convicted of spying for Britain - have told the BBC Russian Service that he believed the Russian special services might come after him at any time. His wife, elder brother and his son have died in the past two years, some in mysterious circumstances, the family believe. Ms Skripal lives in Moscow and has visited her father in the UK regularly, especially over the past two years. This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. CCTV footage shows a man and woman walking near the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found Mr Skripal and his daughter were found slumped and unconscious on a bench outside a shopping centre on Sunday afternoon. CCTV footage has been released by police which appears to show the pair walking through an alleyway near a Zizzi restaurant shortly before they collapsed. Police have since sealed off the restaurant and The Bishop's Mill pub was also cordoned off as a precaution. On Tuesday evening, police extended the cordon and shut off a bridge. Eyewitness Jamie Paine said the woman he saw was passed out, frothing at the mouth and her eyes ""were wide open but completely white"". He added: ""The man went stiff, his arms stopped moving but he was still looking dead straight."" Two police officers caught up in the suspected contamination have been treated in hospital for minor symptoms, before they were given the all clear. It is understood their symptoms included itchy eyes and wheezing. A third member of the emergency services remains in hospital. Scientists at Porton Down - the UK's secret weapons research facility in Wiltshire - are studying the ""unknown substance"". On Tuesday evening, BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban said there are concerns the pair's conditions could worsen. Despite the sending of samples, scientists have still not identified the substance and one official at Porton Down said ""we are treating symptoms rather than causes"", Urban said. Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, Mr Johnson said: ""Honourable members will note the echoes of the death of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006. ""I say to governments around the world that no attempt to take innocent life on UK soil will go unsanctioned or unpunished."" Mr Johnson said the UK was ""in the lead across the world"" in trying to counteract a ""host of malign activity"" by Russia. This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Russian spy attack: What we know so far Russia has insisted it has ""no information"" about what could have led to the incident, but says it is open to co-operating with British police if requested. In a statement, the Russian embassy in London said: ""Media reports create an impression of a planned operation by the Russian special services, which is completely untrue."" Responding to Mr Johnson's comments, the embassy added: ""Looks like the script of yet another anti-Russian campaign has been already written."" BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban said Boris Johnson's strongly-worded statement indicates that the Government is ""party to some kind of intelligence"". ""It's evident from the foreign secretary's statement, and certainly the view in Whitehall is, he would not have gone this far unless the government was party to some kind of intelligence about what had gone on,"" Urban said. Col Skripal, 66, had been living in Salisbury after being released by Russia in 2010 Colonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI as part of a swap. He was later flown to the UK. According to BBC Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban, in recent years Col Skripal gave lectures at military academies offering insight into Russia's foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU. Tony Brenton, the former British ambassador to Russia, suggested that Mr Skripal would have had many enemies - including many former colleagues He said: ""The fact that he blew a whole range of Russian agents, there may be personal animosities there. ""In most Russians' minds he would be categorised as a traitor. There are people there who would be delighted to see him dead."" The possibility of an unexplained substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko. The Russian dissident and former intelligence officer died in London after drinking tea laced with a radioactive substance. A public inquiry concluded that his killing had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Andrei Lugovoi, the former Russian agent accused of poisoning Litvinenko but who denies the claims, told the BBC that Russia would have considered the matter closed when Mr Skripal was flown to the UK as part of a spy swap in 2010. This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Andrei Lugovoi, a suspect in the Litvinenko poisoning, rejects suggestions that Russia was behind Sergei Skripal's collapse Mr Skripal was pardoned by the Russian President and so the incident was over, Mr Lugovoi said. Igor Sutyagin, who was one of four agents released by Moscow in the exchange, is now a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). He told the BBC's World Tonight programme that he was not yet concerned for his safety and added: ""I don't think that he (Mr Skripal) would be targeted, because he was pardoned."" But Mr Litvinenko's widow, Marina Litvinenko, told the programme that the latest incident felt like ""deja vu"" - and called for those receiving political asylum to be protected by the UK. Meanwhile, the Home Affairs Committee has asked for a review into 14 deaths that have not been treated as suspicious by British police but have reportedly been identified as potentially linked to Russia. Russian state TV's coverage of the possible poisoning in the UK of former agent Sergei Skripal has been eccentric, to say the least. State TV remains the main source of news for most Russians. The main official TV channel, Rossiya 1, covered the story early in the day, but studiously ignored any comparison with the poisoning in 2006 of former Russian FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko, which has been a prominent feature of reports in the UK media. This evening, the main primetime bulletin on Rossiya 1 and the two other main Russian TV stations, Channel One and NTV, did not touch the story. The oddities in the coverage did not stop there, though. On Rossiya 24, the country's main news channel and the sister channel to Rossiya 1, the Skripal case was the main story this evening, with a report accusing the UK authorities and media of conspiring to blacken Russia's name. The presenter described the case as a ""new classic in British conspirology"" The popular tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda described the case as ""another scandal with a dash of Russophobia"". Russian news agencies reported the indignation expressed by officials as they criticised Boris Johnson's warning to Russia. ""The demonisation of Russia"", said a Russian embassy press release. ""This is preposterous,"" the Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova was quoted as telling Interfax news agency. Mr Johnson's comments are ""unacceptable"" and in ""extremely bad faith,"" said Konstantin Kosachyov, head of the International Affairs Committee of the Federation Council of the upper house of parliament. Although Boris Johnson was careful to stress this was still an ongoing investigation - it's absolutely clear he, and others in government, believe it's highly likely this was a Russian state-sponsored attack. The big question now - how does the government respond? A question made more pressing by accusations that ministers were guilty of appeasement in the wake of Alexander Litvinenko's killing. Mr Johnson suggested there could be targeted sanctions against those close to President Putin. And, perhaps most significantly, in an indication the government could seek to rally international support to make a stand against Russia, Mr Johnson said there could be a co-ordinated response with Nato allies. Whatever measures are eventually decided upon - if Russian involvement is proven - it's clear relations between London and Moscow have plunged to new depths.

"The takeover of Sunrise Senior Living Inc. at the biggest premium ever paid for an operator of homes for the elderly is turning companies from Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (BKD) to Emeritus Corp. into the next targets. Brookdale, the industry’s largest company with a market value of $2.7 billion, has the group’s lowest valuation relative to cash flow , and its operating margin is projected to reach a record high next quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Emeritus, the second-biggest, fell last month to the cheapest price since 2005 versus the cash it generates. Occupancy rates at senior communities are rising, and real estate investment trusts are vying for deals because the properties are undervalued, Stifel Financial Corp. said. Health Care REIT Inc. (HCN) agreed in August to pay an 87 percent premium for Sunrise, the highest ever for a retirement or senior-care center, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Royal Bank of Canada said suitors may now evaluate Brookdale, while JMP Group Inc. sees Emeritus (ESC) and Capital Senior Living Corp. (CSU) as likely targets. Health-care REITS “have demonstrated a strong interest in senior housing,” Jeffrey Kolitch, New York-based manager of the Baron Real Estate Fund (BREFX) at Baron Capital Inc., which oversees $17 billion, said in a telephone interview. “We are in the early stages of a cyclical recovery. Many of the public senior housing operators, such as Brookdale Senior Living, Capital Senior Living and Emeritus, trade at meaningful discounts. Further consolidation in the senior housing industry is a strong possibility.” Underlying Value The Baron Real Estate Fund has outperformed 99 percent of rival funds in the past year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The firm owned shares of Brookdale, Capital Senior, Emeritus and Sunrise as of June 30, the data show. Ross Roadman, a spokesman for Brentwood, Tennessee-based Brookdale, didn’t return a phone call seeking comment. Sari Martin, a spokeswoman for Seattle-based Emeritus, declined to comment on whether the company has been approached by potential suitors or would consider a sale. “The acquisition of Sunrise Senior Living brought to the attention of many investors the value of the underlying real estate in the senior living industry,” Ralph Beattie, chief financial officer at Dallas-based Capital Senior, wrote in an e- mail. “While I cannot comment regarding any confidential discussions that may have taken place, I can say that CSU remains committed to increasing value for all of our shareholders. Our interests are fully aligned and we have an excellent Board that will always serve our shareholders by professionally discharging their fiduciary duty.” Higher Occupancy The number of residents living in senior-housing communities is on the rise, buoying the revenue and profit outlook for the center operators, said Daniel Bernstein, a Baltimore-based analyst with Stifel. With higher occupancy rates, “you start to see the ability to raise monthly rental rates to residents,” he said in a phone interview. “They’re starting to approach 90 percent. You’re going to see some accelerating rent growth.” The average occupancy rate for U.S. senior-housing properties in the second quarter increased for a ninth straight period to 88.6 percent, as the pace of annual rent growth reached its highest level since 2009, according to data from the National Investment Center for the Seniors Housing & Care Industry. Brookdale’s revenue is projected to surge to a record this year and next, and the business is expected to post a net profit for the first time in 2013, analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. Emeritus and Capital Senior may also draw record sales next year. ‘Opportunistic Time’ “The industry looks to improve and it’s creating an opportunistic time to buy,” Peter Martin, a San Francisco-based analyst with JMP, said in a phone interview. Health Care REIT, the industry’s third-largest company by market value, agreed last month to buy McLean, Virginia-based Sunrise for about $845 million to expand its assisted-living communities. The number of residents aged 65 and over will increase 79 percent through 2030, Health Care REIT said in a regulatory filing, citing Census Bureau data. The $14.50-a-share cash offer was 87 percent more than Sunrise’s average stock price in the prior 20 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the highest premium a buyer has ever paid for a retirement or senior-care center operator, and more than double the average of 35 percent, the data show. ‘Improving Fundamentals’ Brookdale’s undervalued stock and attractive properties could lure suitors, said Frank Morgan, a Brentwood-based analyst with RBC. Brookdale, which runs 647 senior-living communities, was the largest U.S. operator based on capacity at the end of 2011, according to its annual report. The stock traded yesterday at 10 times estimated cash flow for this year, a lower multiple than Emeritus and Capital Senior, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Analysts estimate Brookdale will boost its operating margin in the fourth quarter to a record, earning 5.8 cents on every dollar of sales. “Brookdale’s stock price doesn’t really reflect the improving fundamentals,” Morgan said in a phone interview. Given the interest in Sunrise, “it should not come as a surprise to anyone that investors have also connected the dots for Brookdale as at least another candidate. It generates a lot of cash flow.” Today, shares of Brookdale rose 6 percent to $23.39, the largest increase in more than a month and the second-biggest gain in the Russell 1000 Health Care Index. Brookdale Chief Executive Officer Bill Sheriff said on Aug. 9 that he’s planning to retire and will remain at the helm until a successor is named. Some investors may view the change as potentially paving the way for a deal, Morgan said. Private Equity Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) , a New York-based private- equity firm, acquired Brookdale in 2000 and took the company public five years later. The firm is still Brookdale’s largest shareholder with about a 14 percent stake. Gordon Runte, a spokesman for the firm, declined to comment on its plans for the Brookdale stake. Emeritus and Capital Senior are even more appealing takeover candidates because they are smaller than Brookdale and own a large proportion of their properties, said JMP’s Martin. Emeritus, with a market capitalization of $944 million yesterday, and Capital Senior, at $409 million, each own almost 40 percent of the communities they manage, according to their annual reports. Both companies are too small to make significant acquisitions on their own, and the premiums REITs are willing to pay would be enticing, Martin said. On Aug. 1, Emeritus’ stock slipped to 7.5 times the value of its free cash flow for the last 12 months, the lowest ratio since Sept. 2005, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. ‘Best Decision’ The value of the company’s net assets is about $26 a share, Martin estimates. Emeritus shares ended yesterday at $20.95. Capital Senior, which considered a possible sale in 2008, has a net asset value of about $20 a share, according to Martin, 38 percent higher than yesterday’s closing price. “The best decision for their shareholders would be to sell to a REIT to deliver the most value to shareholders,” he said. Today, shares of Emeritus increased 2.2 percent to $21.40, while Capital Senior rose 1 percent to $14.67, the highest closing price since 1999. Still, Brookdale shares had already gained 69 percent in the past year through yesterday, while Emeritus had appreciated 45 percent and Capital Senior’s stock more than doubled . Analysts are projecting all three will continue climbing in the next year even without a sale, estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. Property Trusts Stifel’s Bernstein says buyers might include HCP Inc. (HCP) , Ventas Inc. (VTR) or even Health Care REIT, which announced its deal for Sunrise on Aug. 22. The three potential suitors are organized as REITs, and their market values, ranging from $15 billion to $19 billion, dwarf Brookdale and the rest of the senior-housing companies. REITs develop and own everything from warehouses to skyscrapers and assisted-living homes. The property trusts can avoid paying corporate taxes in the U.S. when they distribute at least 90 percent of their net income as dividends. The possible acquirers all have low capital costs and good cash-flow generation, which would help fund a transaction, Bernstein said. A spokesman at Health Care REIT in Toledo, Ohio , declined to comment. Representatives for Long Beach , California-based HCP and Chicago-based Ventas didn’t respond to e-mail or phone messages. HCP, Ventas or Health Care REIT may prefer to purchase specific assets of the remaining publicly traded senior-living operators, rather than the entire corporations, according to Bernstein. “There’s still a lot of real estate to be consolidated out of the public senior-housing operators, whether we see another outright sale of a company or not,” he said. “But the takeover of Sunrise certainly opens that door.” To contact the reporter on this story: Tara Lachapelle in New York at tlachapelle@bloomberg.net .

* Health Care REIT's acquisition of Sunrise Senior Living for $845 million at an 87% premium—the highest ever paid for a senior-care operator—has triggered investor speculation that larger publicly traded competitors face takeover risk. Rising occupancy rates across the sector, now averaging 88.6% in Q2 (up for nine consecutive periods), combined with accelerating rent growth at the highest pace since 2009, have made senior housing properties increasingly attractive to REITs seeking undervalued assets.

* Brookdale Senior Living, the industry's largest operator with a $2.7 billion market value, trades at just 10 times estimated cash flow—the lowest multiple among peers—while projecting record operating margins of 5.8% in Q4 2012. RBC analyst Frank Morgan stated that ""Brookdale's stock price doesn't really reflect the improving fundamentals,"" noting the company ""generates a lot of cash flow."" Emeritus (market cap $944 million) and Capital Senior Living ($409 million) are viewed as even more attractive targets by JMP Group, with Emeritus trading at 7.5 times free cash flow—its lowest ratio since September 2005. JMP analyst Peter Martin estimates Emeritus's net asset value at approximately $26 per share versus its $20.95 closing price, while Capital Senior's net asset value of $20 per share represents 38% upside from its $14.67 close. Brookdale shares surged 6% to $23.39 on acquisition speculation, while Emeritus and Capital Senior gained 2.2% and 1% respectively.

**In essence, sector consolidation is accelerating as REITs capitalize on undervalued senior housing operators with improving occupancy and margin fundamentals.**"
"Esterline Technologies Corp. (ESL) , the aerospace supplier facing pressure from one of its largest investors to boost its valuation, is poised to hand shareholders a return of at least 37 percent as a takeover target. Relational Investors LLC, Esterline’s third-biggest stockholder , said last week that the company needs to improve profitability and make better use of its capital as the shares trade at a “substantial discount” to its potential takeover price. Even after rising 17 percent this year, the Bellevue, Washington-based company was valued yesterday at a 7 percent discount to analysts’ estimates for next year’s sales, a multiple that’s 28 percent less than the average for North American aerospace and defense parts makers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While Esterline has more net debt relative to its earnings than 91 percent of peers and generates the least profit from each dollar of invested capital, Stephens Inc. said the company could lure buyers as net income and sales climb to records this year and next. BAE Systems Plc (BA/) may be among interested acquirers for the maker of parts used in stealth aircraft and commercial jets, according to Penn Capital Management Co. Esterline, which closed at $65.49 yesterday, may command at least $90 a share in a takeover, said Stephens and Credit Suisse Group AG. “Any of the big conglomerates that want to get bigger in defense could find Esterline attractive,” Eric Green , a Philadelphia-based fund manager at Penn Capital, which oversees $6 billion including Esterline shares, said in a telephone interview. “It’s trading at a very attractive valuation and the fundamentals and outlook are very good.” Sensors, Systems Shares of Esterline today fell 1.4 percent to $64.59. Brian Keogh, a spokesman for Esterline, didn’t respond to phone calls seeking comment. The company, which traces its roots to Indianapolis in 1906, makes a range of products for the aerospace and defense industries such as sensors, flight management systems and noise- reduction headsets. It also supplies automakers, gaming companies and medical-equipment manufacturers. From their all-time high of $81.96 in July, Esterline’s shares were down 21 percent as of May 23, the day before Relational disclosed in a regulatory filing that it had increased its stake in the company to 6.6 percent. Relational said that the company’s stock is undervalued and called on management to improve operations, reduce debt and avoid costly acquisitions. The San Diego-based firm, which manages about $6 billion, cited Esterline’s “sub-optimal operating performance” relative to both margins and return on invested capital. Below Average Esterline’s operating margin was about 10 percent in the last 12 months, lower than the 15 percent average among North American aerospace and defense parts makers with a market value of at least $1 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It earned 7 cents in profit from every dollar of invested capital, less than any of its peers, while its net debt is 2.9 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, more than twice the industry average, the data show. Relational said that while Esterline’s shares could get a lift if the company improves its operations, “over time the shares will continue to sell for a substantial discount to the value available in a strategic sale to a larger company.” It said a potential premium from a strategic buyer “should form the backdrop of strategic planning and related decisions” made by the board. ‘Right Thing’ Ralph Whitworth, Relational’s co-founder, said in a May 24 interview that while he hasn’t urged the company to put itself up for sale, he “wouldn’t want them to be eschewing offers.” Whitworth wasn’t available to comment further, said his assistant Christina Martinez. “Relational is doing the right thing,” Zachary Prensky, a New York-based fund manager at Little Bear Research LLC, said in a phone interview. “I think these guys are going to dig in.” Esterline was valued yesterday at 0.93 times next year’s revenue, which analysts estimate will rise to a record $2.16 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with the industry’s average multiple of 1.29 times fiscal 2013 estimated sales, the data show. The company offers potential acquirers both the opportunity to gain scale in the defense market and protection from cuts in U.S. military spending because of its commercial aircraft products, said Green at Penn Capital, which owned about 290,000 Esterline shares as of March 31. Target Appeal Esterline, which generates 45 percent of its revenue in the commercial aerospace market by selling everything from pilot grips to radar display screens, may lure buyers seeking more commercial customers as its sales and earnings ramp up, said Eric Hugel, a New York-based analyst for Stephens. Esterline would also be appealing to suitors looking to increase their presence in the defense industry because 40 percent of its sales are military products such as infrared decoy flares used to confuse heat-guided missiles. Acquirers would be getting a company that boosted its free cash flow in four of the last five years and is projected to produce a record of about $224 million this fiscal year, which ends in October, data compiled by Bloomberg show. “You’ve got a company here that generates good, consistent free cash flow ,” Hugel said in a phone interview. “They have a lot of good technology. It would be an attractive candidate for the right kind of business where there would be a fair amount of synergies.” Likely Suitor Esterline’s stock rose 10 percent on March 23, its biggest one-day gain since September 2009, after U.K. newspapers the Daily Mail and the Guardian said, without naming their sources, that aerospace and defense firms are interested in acquiring the company. The Daily Mail said one of the potential buyers was about to begin a bid of more than $95 a share. The most likely suitor may be BAE, Europe ’s largest defense company, Penn Capital’s Green said. A takeover of Esterline may add to earnings for BAE, which is already one of its biggest customers , he said. Brian Roehrkasse, a spokesman for London-based BAE, said the company doesn’t comment on speculation regarding mergers and acquisitions, when asked whether it has considered a takeover of Esterline. Esterline’s depressed valuation may not be enough to convince buyers to take on the entire company, said Michael Callahan, a New York-based analyst for Auriga USA LLC. Callahan said acquirers may be interested in only certain parts of Esterline’s diverse product mix. ‘Doesn’t Fit’ “It doesn’t fit a plain vanilla defense or commercial aerospace company,” Callahan said in a phone interview. “They have a lot more going on than just that.” Still, Esterline’s market capitalization of about $2 billion is “in the sweet spot” for many potential suitors, said Julie Yates, a New York-based analyst for Credit Suisse. Esterline has “a very attractive set of capabilities on the commercial aerospace side,” Yates said in a phone interview. “They have an accelerating organic growth profile.” Takeover offers for the company may range from $90 to $100 a share, Yates and Stephens’ Hugel said. That implies a premium between 37 percent and 53 percent to yesterday’s closing price. “The best way to solve the problems is to sell the company,” Little Bear’s Prensky said. Relational is “pushing these guys in the right direction. They will find somebody who will want the whole thing.” To contact the reporters on this story: Tara Lachapelle in New York at tlachapelle@bloomberg.net ; Thomas Black in Dallas at tblack@bloomberg.net .

"DUBUQUE, Iowa--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Flexsteel Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLXS) today reported second quarter and fiscal year-to-date financial results. Financial Highlights: Net sales were $129.4 million, up 9.2%, a record quarter; Net sales were $249.2 million for the current six months, an increase of 8.1%; and Net income for six months increased $0.27 per share, including gain on facility sale and tax reform impact. Net sales for the quarters ended December 31, (in millions): 2017 2016 $ Change % Change Residential $ 110.8 $ 100.5 $ 10.3 10.2 % Contract 18.6 18.0 0.6 3.3 % Total $ 129.4 $ 118.5 $ 10.9 9.2 % Net sales for the six months ended December 31, (in millions): 2017 2016 $ Change % Change Residential $ 212.6 $ 194.2 $ 18.4 9.5 % Contract 36.6 36.4 0.2 0.5 % Total $ 249.2 $ 230.6 $ 18.6 8.1 % Net sales were $129.4 million for the quarter compared to net sales of $118.5 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of 9.2%. Net sales were $249.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 8.1%. For both the quarter and the six-month period, higher residential net sales are primarily due to increased volume and to a lesser extent new customers. Higher contract net sales are primarily due to increased volume offset by the previously disclosed intentional decrease in sales to certain customers. Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was 21.2%, compared to 22.6% for the prior year quarter. For the six months ended December 31, 2017, gross margin as a percent of net sales was 21.5%, compared to 23.1% for the prior year period. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to increased labor and raw material costs partially offset by volume leverage on fixed costs. In response to margin pressure, the Company implemented select sales price increases late in the fiscal quarter. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were 15.2% of net sales in the current year quarter, compared to 15.5% of net sales in the prior year quarter. For the six months ended December 31, 2017, SG&A expenses decreased to 15.2% compared to 16.1% in the prior year period primarily due to improved fixed cost leverage. During the current fiscal year, the Company completed a $6.5 million sale of a facility and recognized a pre-tax gain of $1.8 million. On an after-tax basis, the gain represents $1.3 million or $0.16 per share. The effective tax rate for the current year quarter was 21.1% compared to 36.7% in the prior year quarter. For the six months ended December 31, 2017, the effective tax rate was 30.2% compared to 37.7% in the prior year period. The current year quarter and fiscal year-to-date rates were positively impacted by the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) resulting in a $0.16 per share increase in net income. Beginning in fiscal year 2019, the Company expects the effective tax rate to be between 25% and 27%. The above factors resulted in net income of $6.2 million or $0.78 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $5.3 million or $0.68 per share in the prior year quarter. For the six months ended December 31, 2017, net income was $12.4 million or $1.56 per share compared to $10.1 million or $1.29 per share in the prior year period. Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) at December 31, 2017 was $163 million compared to $158 million at June 30, 2017. Changes in working capital include increases of $11 million in inventory, $5 million in accounts receivable, $2 million in investments and $2 million in accounts payable; and a decrease of $11 million in cash and cash equivalents. Accounts receivable increased due to increased sales volume. Inventory increased to improve service levels. For the six months ended December 31, 2017, capital expenditures were $12.9 million including $6.8 million invested to upgrade the business information system and $3.7 million for the construction of a new manufacturing facility. All earnings per share amounts are on a diluted basis. Outlook During the remainder of fiscal year 2018, the Company expects high single digit revenue growth including the previously disclosed intentional decrease in sales to certain contract customers. The Company expects continued inflationary pressure on certain raw materials and moderating labor cost increases. The Company is focused on gross margin expansion through targeted sales price increases, enhanced service levels and driving operational efficiencies. For the balance of the fiscal year, the Company expects to capitalize $2 million related to business information system software and development, $10 million for the construction of a manufacturing facility and $2 million for operations. The Company believes it has adequate working capital and borrowing capabilities to meet these requirements. The Company remains committed to its core strategies, which include providing a wide range of quality product offerings and price points to the residential and contract markets, combined with a conservative approach to business. The Company will maintain its focus on a strong balance sheet through emphasis on cash flow and increasing profitability. The Company believes these core strategies are in the best interest of its shareholders.

* Flexsteel Industries reported second-quarter net sales of $129.4 million, a record for the quarter and up 9.2% year-over-year from $118.5 million, driven primarily by increased residential furniture volume and new customer acquisition. However, the furniture manufacturer faced significant cost headwinds that pressured profitability despite the strong top-line performance, marking a challenging operating environment for the cyclical industry.

* Diluted EPS reached $0.78 for the quarter versus $0.68 in the prior year, a 14.7% increase, though gross margin contracted to 21.2% from 22.6% due to elevated labor and raw material costs. For the six-month period, net sales climbed 8.1% to $249.2 million while diluted EPS grew to $1.56 from $1.29, benefiting from a $1.3 million after-tax gain on a $6.5 million facility sale and a $0.16 per share tax reform benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Management stated the company ""implemented select sales price increases late in the fiscal quarter"" to combat margin pressure and expects ""continued inflationary pressure on certain raw materials and moderating labor cost increases"" through fiscal 2018. Capital expenditures totaled $12.9 million in the first half, including $6.8 million for business information system upgrades and $3.7 million for new manufacturing facility construction. The company guided for high single-digit revenue growth for the remainder of fiscal 2018, with focus on gross margin expansion through pricing and operational efficiencies.

**In essence, Flexsteel achieved record quarterly revenue growth but faces persistent cost inflation requiring aggressive pricing actions to protect margins.**"
"EXTON, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Innovative Solutions & Support, Inc. (“IS&S” or the “Company”) ( ISSC ) today announced its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ended December 31, 2017. For the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company reported net sales of $3.1 million, down 10% from the first quarter a year ago. The Company reported a net loss of $0.9 million, or ($0.05) per share, for the quarter, an improvement from the net loss of $1.2 million, or ($0.07) per share, recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Geoffrey Hedrick, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of IS&S, said, “Results in the first quarter reflect the low beginning backlog at the beginning of the fiscal year. While revenues were down in the first quarter, our focus on more profitable production sales and tight cost control has enabled us to generate gross margins approaching 50%, and, we remain committed to internal research and development, with over $900,000, or 30% of revenue, invested in new product work this quarter. We have further broadened our product portfolio with the recent introduction of our patent-pending Autothrottle. The recent Business & Commercial Aviation February 2018 cover story, has created interest in the Autothrottle’s application into several other aircraft. We anticipate rapidly growing demand with the receipt of an STC for the standalone version of our PC-12 Autothrottle with a market of over 1,400 aircraft, which we believe is imminent. Once the King Air Autothrottle is certified, we expect to have Autothrottle certifications that will open up a market in excess of 10,000 aircraft for which we will be the sole source of the industry’s leading Autothrottle retrofit, which we believe will be an engine of future growth.” At December 31, 2017, the Company had $24.7 million of cash on hand, virtually unchanged from fiscal year end September 30, 2017. New orders in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were $3.4 million and backlog as of December 31, 2017 was $3.3 million, up 10% from September 30, 2017. Backlog does not include follow on production orders from products developed under the Company’s engineering development contracts, including the Pilatus PC-24, and the KC-46A, all of which the Company expects to remain in production for a decade. The Company expects that these contracts will add to production sales already in backlog. Shahram Askarpour, President of IS&S, added, “I am pleased with the progress we have achieved in establishing a strong market presence solely on the foundation of products we have internally developed. We believe the strength of this strategy can be seen in our gross profits, which reflect the attractive margins of production orders, even at volumes below our historic norms. With the introduction of the only FAA-certified Turboprop Autothrottle, we are essentially creating an entirely new market. Now, we are adding a retrofit standalone version, which significantly reduces the price point, making this a more economical, accessible choice and expanding the products applications. Over the past few years, we have transitioned IS&S away from large burdensome engineering programs and towards opportunities that we believe better leverage our proprietary technology with significantly lower risk. As we add more internally developed products to our growing portfolio, we can better capitalize on the growth opportunities emerging from impending FAA mandates and the industry’s increasing emphasis on price-for-performance procurement.” Conference Call The Company will be hosting a conference call on Wednesday, February 14, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. ET to discuss these results and its business outlook.

* Innovative Solutions & Support reported Q1 fiscal 2018 net sales of $3.1 million, down 10% year-over-year from $3.365 million in Q1 fiscal 2017, reflecting a low beginning backlog at fiscal year start. Despite the revenue contraction, the company narrowed its net loss and maintained strong gross margins while investing heavily in product development, positioning itself for growth from newly launched aviation products.

* Net loss improved to $0.9 million, or ($0.05) per share, compared to ($0.07) per share in the prior-year quarter, representing a 29% reduction in losses. Gross profit margin approached 50% despite lower volumes, while R&D spending reached $923,721 (30% of revenue), demonstrating commitment to innovation. CEO Geoffrey Hedrick stated, ""Our focus on more profitable production sales and tight cost control has enabled us to generate gross margins approaching 50%,"" and highlighted that ""we anticipate rapidly growing demand with the receipt of an STC for the standalone version of our PC-12 Autothrottle with a market of over 1,400 aircraft."" New orders totaled $3.4 million with backlog rising 10% to $3.3 million as of December 31, 2017. Cash remained stable at $24.7 million. The company expects future growth from FAA certifications of its patent-pending Autothrottle retrofit systems, which management believes will address markets exceeding 10,000 aircraft and establish IS&S as the sole-source supplier.

**In essence, IS&S is sacrificing near-term revenue for margin quality and product innovation, betting on imminent Autothrottle certifications to drive substantial future growth.**"
